### Introduction
Welcome to my 'dating' app repository. I am developing an app that's focusing on finding free collaborations between photographers and models. The focus of this application is on login and register for now. 

### Job story
When I am just starting to boost my portfolio as a photographer, I want to create an account that will portray me as a hobby photographer, so I can find models that will be suited for my photoshoot ideas.
