# dating_app2021

### Introduction
Welcome to my 'dating' app repository. I am developing an app that's focusing on finding free collaborations between photographers and models, so it's not a dating app in the traditional way. 


## Get started
If you want to install this repository, follow these next steps.

1. Clone this repository
2. I am using Node.js and NPM so you will need to install this as well. You can do this as followed:
`      npm install`
3. Install all the packages from my JSON file.
4. To run, enter the following code in your terminal: `     nodemon run dev`
